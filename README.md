# BackwardInhibitionGorilla

Code for running a backward inhibition task using **Gorilla Experiment Builder**.

The implementation generates stimuli that vary in color, shape, and size, and injects them into the Gorilla task spreadsheet via post-processing.

Based on:

Mayr, U., & Keele, S. W. (2000).  
Changing internal constraints on action: the role of backward inhibition.  
Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, 129(1), 4.

## Status

⚠️ Research code  
Built for experimental use.  
Assumes specific Gorilla spreadsheet structure.

## Notes

- Stimuli are generated dynamically per trial
- Not packaged as a standalone library
